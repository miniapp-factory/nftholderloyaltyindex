Receive insights into collector behavior and loyalty trends across projects.

Key Features:
 • Analysis of average holding duration per NFT collection
 • Identification of loyal holders vs. frequent sellers
 • Real-time alerts when loyalty metrics shift
 • Historical charts showing changes in holder retention
 • Dashboard to compare loyalty levels across multiple collections

Use Case:
Perfect for NFT collectors, researchers, and traders who want to understand community strength, detect stable projects, and evaluate long-term holder conviction before making buying decisions.

#### Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.  

The files that will need to be edited to satisfy the request are:

1. **mini-app/lib/metadata.ts** – to update the `title` and `description` values.  
2. **mini-app/public/logo.png.todo** – a new file that will describe the logo to be generated.

Please add `mini-app/lib/metadata.ts` to the chat so I can provide the exact SEARCH/REPLACE blocks for that file. Once that file is added, I’ll also create the `logo.png.todo` file.

A stylized logo featuring a geometric NFT token symbol with a heart overlay, representing loyalty and retention. The symbol is a simple shape with a gradient from blue to green, and a small heart in the center. The background is a subtle gradient from light gray to white. The overall design is clean, modern, and conveys trust and community.
